			<title>Current stimulation to the brain partially restores vision in patients with glaucoma and optic nerve damage</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160629145208.htm</link>
			<description>Vision loss due to glaucoma or optic nerve damage is generally considered irreversible. Now a new prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical trial demonstrates significant vision improvement in partially blind patients after 10 days of noninvasive, transorbital alternating current stimulation. In addition to activation of their residual vision, patients also experienced improvement in vision-related quality of life such as acuity, reading, mobility or orientation. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Little to no association between butter consumption, chronic disease or total mortality</title>

			<description>Species across the world are rapidly going extinct due to human activities, but humans are also causing rapid evolution and the emergence of new species. A new study summarizes the causes of humanmade speciation, and discusses why newly evolved species cannot simply replace extinct wild species. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Our ancestors evolved three times faster in the 10 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs than in the previous 80 million years, according to researchers. The team found the speed of evolution of placental mammals -- a group that today includes nearly 5000 species including humans -- was constant before the extinction event but exploded after, resulting in the varied groups of mammals we see today. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Hubble reveals stellar fireworks in &#039;skyrocket&#039; galaxy</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160628141521.htm</link>
			<description>A new Hubble Space Telescope image shows a firestorm of star birth lighting up one end of the diminutive galaxy Kiso 5639. The dwarf galaxy is shaped like a flattened pancake, but because it is tilted edge-on, it resembles a skyrocket, with a brilliant blazing head and a long, star-studded tail. Kiso 5639 is a member of a class of galaxies called &quot;tadpoles&quot; because of their bright heads and elongated tails. This galaxy resides relatively nearby, at 82 million light-years away. Tadpoles are rare in the local universe but more common in the distant cosmos, suggesting that many galaxies pass through a phase like this as they evolve. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>How do the cells in a human embryo know where they are located in the body and how they should develop? Why do certain cells form a finger while others do not? Biologists have explained the mechanisms that control these steps by showing why veins form at particular points in the wing of a fruit fly. The protein Pentagone spreads a particular signal in the wing that tells the cells how to behave. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Researchers identify possible link between the environment and puberty</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160628114122.htm</link>
			<description>A possible epigenetic link between the environment and pubertal timing has been discovered by researchers. To a large extent, pubertal timing is heritable, but the underlying genetic causes are still unexplained. Researchers have now studied how chemical modifications of the human genome (so-called epigenetic modifications) change when girls and boys enter puberty. The results indicate that such epigenetic changes are involved in defining the onset of puberty. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Rotating ring of complex organic molecules discovered around newborn star: Chemical diversity in planet forming regions unveiled</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160628072426.htm</link>
			<description>Researchers have discovered a rotating ring containing large organic molecules around a protostar. This observation definitively shows that organic materials formed in interstellar space are brought into the planet-forming region. Researchers also found that the molecular species brought into the planet-forming region vary from one protostar to another. Chemical composition is a new way to answer the long-standing question of whether or not the Solar System is a typical example of a planetary system. <!-- more --></description>

			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160628072249.htm</link>
			<description>Astronomers have concluded that a peculiar source of radio waves thought to be a distant galaxy is actually a nearby binary star system containing a low-mass star and a black hole. This identification suggests there may be a vast number of black holes in our Galaxy that have gone unnoticed until now. <!-- more --></description>

This research has found the Caribbean Current flow is unstable, which causes it to shed eddies, or swirling currents of water hundreds of kilometers in diameter. This is similar to the way in which a jet of air sheds eddies when it hits the lip of a whistle. <!-- more --></description>

Four of the crops grown were tested for heavy metal content. No concentrations were detected that would be dangerous for human health. The four crops are therefore safe to eat and, for some heavy metals, the concentrations were even lower than in the crops grown in potting soil. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Astronomers have detected what may be the most rapidly rotating, ultra-cool, brown-dwarf star ever seen. The super-fast rotation period was measured by using the 305-meter Arecibo radio telescope -- the same telescope that was used to discover the first planets ever found outside our solar system. The detection emphasizes Arecibo&#039;s amazing sensitivity, which has the potential to measure the magnetic fields, which protect life, of potentially habitable planets around other stars. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Ancient &#039;Deep Skull&#039; from Borneo full of surprises</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160627094831.htm</link>
			<description>A new study of the 37,000-year old remains of the &#039;Deep Skull&#039; -- the oldest modern human discovered in island South-East Asia -- has revealed this ancient person was not related to Indigenous Australians, as had been originally thought. The Deep Skull was also likely to have been an older woman, rather than a teenage boy, the research shows. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Sparrows with unfaithful &#039;wives&#039; care less for their young</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624155002.htm</link>
			<description>Sparrows form pair bonds that are normally monogamous, but many females are unfaithful to their partner and have offspring with other males. Biologists believe that the male birds are unfaithful to ensure they father as many chicks as they can, while females are unfaithful with males of better &#039;genetic quality&#039; -- ones that are fitter and could produce stronger offspring. But new research shows that cheating comes with a cost -- the cheating female&#039;s partner will provide less food for their nest of young. <!-- more --></description>

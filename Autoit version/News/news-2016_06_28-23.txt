			<title>Humans artificially drive evolution of new species</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160628221714.htm</link>
			<description>Species across the world are rapidly going extinct due to human activities, but humans are also causing rapid evolution and the emergence of new species. A new study summarizes the causes of humanmade speciation, and discusses why newly evolved species cannot simply replace extinct wild species. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Hubble reveals stellar fireworks in &#039;skyrocket&#039; galaxy</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160628141521.htm</link>
			<description>A new Hubble Space Telescope image shows a firestorm of star birth lighting up one end of the diminutive galaxy Kiso 5639. The dwarf galaxy is shaped like a flattened pancake, but because it is tilted edge-on, it resembles a skyrocket, with a brilliant blazing head and a long, star-studded tail. Kiso 5639 is a member of a class of galaxies called &quot;tadpoles&quot; because of their bright heads and elongated tails. This galaxy resides relatively nearby, at 82 million light-years away. Tadpoles are rare in the local universe but more common in the distant cosmos, suggesting that many galaxies pass through a phase like this as they evolve. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>How do the cells in a human embryo know where they are located in the body and how they should develop? Why do certain cells form a finger while others do not? Biologists have explained the mechanisms that control these steps by showing why veins form at particular points in the wing of a fruit fly. The protein Pentagone spreads a particular signal in the wing that tells the cells how to behave. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Researchers identify possible link between the environment and puberty</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160628114122.htm</link>
			<description>A possible epigenetic link between the environment and pubertal timing has been discovered by researchers. To a large extent, pubertal timing is heritable, but the underlying genetic causes are still unexplained. Researchers have now studied how chemical modifications of the human genome (so-called epigenetic modifications) change when girls and boys enter puberty. The results indicate that such epigenetic changes are involved in defining the onset of puberty. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Rotating ring of complex organic molecules discovered around newborn star: Chemical diversity in planet forming regions unveiled</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160628072426.htm</link>
			<description>Researchers have discovered a rotating ring containing large organic molecules around a protostar. This observation definitively shows that organic materials formed in interstellar space are brought into the planet-forming region. Researchers also found that the molecular species brought into the planet-forming region vary from one protostar to another. Chemical composition is a new way to answer the long-standing question of whether or not the Solar System is a typical example of a planetary system. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Scientists have discovered the Caribbean Sea works like a whistle. This finding will enable scientists to predict some sea level changes many months in advance, and may be an important factor in regulating how the Gulf Stream varies. This research has found the Caribbean Current flow is unstable, which causes it to shed eddies, or swirling currents of water hundreds of kilometers in diameter. This is similar to the way in which a jet of air sheds eddies when it hits the lip of a whistle. <!-- more --></description>

Four of the crops grown were tested for heavy metal content. No concentrations were detected that would be dangerous for human health. The four crops are therefore safe to eat and, for some heavy metals, the concentrations were even lower than in the crops grown in potting soil. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Astronomers have detected what may be the most rapidly rotating, ultra-cool, brown-dwarf star ever seen. The super-fast rotation period was measured by using the 305-meter Arecibo radio telescope -- the same telescope that was used to discover the first planets ever found outside our solar system. The detection emphasizes Arecibo&#039;s amazing sensitivity, which has the potential to measure the magnetic fields, which protect life, of potentially habitable planets around other stars. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Sparrows form pair bonds that are normally monogamous, but many females are unfaithful to their partner and have offspring with other males. Biologists believe that the male birds are unfaithful to ensure they father as many chicks as they can, while females are unfaithful with males of better &#039;genetic quality&#039; -- ones that are fitter and could produce stronger offspring. But new research shows that cheating comes with a cost -- the cheating female&#039;s partner will provide less food for their nest of young. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>The potential evolutionary link between hairs in mammals, feathers in birds and scales in reptiles has been debated for decades. Today, researchers demonstrate that all these skin appendages are homologous. On the basis of analyses of embryonic development, the biologists evidenced molecular and micro-anatomical signatures that are identical between hairs, feathers and scales at their early developmental stages. These observations indicate that the three structures evolved from their common reptilian ancestor. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>&#039;Flower Power&#039;: Photovoltaic cells replicate rose petals</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624110028.htm</link>
			<description>With a surface resembling that of plants, solar cells improve light-harvesting and thus generate more power. Scientists reproduced the epidermal cells of rose petals that have particularly good antireflection properties and integrated the transparent replicas into an organic solar cell. This resulted in a relative efficiency gain of twelve percent. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Small brain, astounding performance: How elephantnose fish switch between electrical, visual sense</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624100245.htm</link>
			<description>The elephantnose fish explores objects in its surroundings by using its eyes or its electrical sense -- sometimes both together. Zoologists have now found out how complex the processing of these sensory impressions is. With its tiny brain, the fish achieves performance comparable to that of humans or mammals. <!-- more --></description>

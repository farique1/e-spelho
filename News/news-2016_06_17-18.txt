			<title>Researchers open hairy new chapter in 3-D printing</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160617140606.htm</link>
			<description>Researchers have found a way to bypass a major design step in 3-D printing, to quickly and efficiently model and print thousands of hair-like structures. Instead of using conventional computer-aided design (CAD) software to draw thousands of individual hairs on a computer the team built a new software platform, called &#039;Cilllia,&#039; that lets users define the angle, thickness, density, and height of thousands of hairs, in just a few minutes. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>New lizard found in Dominican Republic</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160617140558.htm</link>
			<description>Biologists have reported the discovery of a new lizard in the Dominican Republic, strengthening a long-held theory that communities of lizards can evolve almost identically on separate islands. The chameleon-like lizard -- a Greater Antillean anole dubbed Anolis landestoyi for the naturalist who first spotted and photographed it -- is one of the first new anole species found in the Dominican Republic in decades. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>In the 1950s, thalidomide (Contergan) was prescribed as a sedative drug to pregnant women, resulting in a great number of infants with serious malformations. Up to now, the reasons for these disastrous birth defects have remained unclear. Researchers have now at last identified the molecular mechanism of thalidomide. Their findings are highly relevant to current cancer therapies, as related substances are essential components of modern cancer treatment regimens. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Unexpected Excess of Giant Planets in Star Cluster Messier 67</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160617082530.htm</link>
			<description>Astronomers have found that there are far more planets of the hot Jupiter type than expected in a cluster of stars called Messier 67. This surprising result was obtained using a number of telescopes and instruments. The denser environment in a cluster will cause more frequent interactions between planets and nearby stars, which may explain the excess of hot Jupiters. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Most distant oxygen ever observed</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160616151306.htm</link>
			<description>A team of astronomers has used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to detect glowing oxygen in a distant galaxy seen just 700 million years after the Big Bang. This is the most distant galaxy in which oxygen has ever been unambiguously detected, and it is most likely being ionized by powerful radiation from young giant stars. This galaxy could be an example of one type of source responsible for cosmic reionization in the early history of the Universe. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Permafrost thawing below shallow Arctic lakes</title>

			<description>Permafrost below shallow Arctic lakes is thawing as a result of changing winter climate, new research shows. These rates of warming are similar to those observed in terrestrial permafrost, yet those soils are still well below freezing and thaw is not expected for at least another 70 years. However, a regime shift in lake ice is leading to sub-lake permafrost thaw now. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Lab-grown nerve cells make heart cells throb</title>

			<title>How fat becomes lethal, even without weight gain</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160616140731.htm</link>
			<description>New research now adds to evidence that other tissues can step in to make glucose when the liver&#039;s ability is impaired, and that the breakdown of fats in the liver is essential to protect it from a lethal onslaught of fat. The new research findings, from studies in mice, are likely to help researchers better understand a growing class of often-deadly metabolic diseases, which affect how the body processes nutrients. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>A single species of gut bacteria can reverse autism-related social behavior in mice</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160616140723.htm</link>
			<description>The absence of a one specific species of gut bacteria causes social deficits in mice, researchers report. By adding this bacteria species back to the guts of affected mice, the researchers were able to reverse some of their behavioral deficits, which are reminiscent of symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in humans. The investigators are now looking to explore the effects of probiotics on neurodevelopmental disorders in future work. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>A new review examines the evidence for 10 common beliefs about vitamin D. The beliefs range from the ability of vitamin D to reduce falls and fractures, improve depression and mental well-being, prevent rheumatoid arthritis, treat Multiple Sclerosis, and lessen incidences of cancer and mortality. The review finds little evidence though that supplementation with this vitamin has much of an effect at all. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Aerosols strengthen storm clouds, lead to extreme weather</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160613153420.htm</link>
			<description>An abundance of aerosol particles in the atmosphere can increase the lifespans of large storm clouds by delaying rainfall, making the clouds grow larger and live longer, and producing more extreme storms, according to new research. The study is the first to address the impact that aerosol particles have on the lifespans of large thunderstorms called mesoscale convective systems. <!-- more --></description>

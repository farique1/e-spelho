			<title>Sparrows with unfaithful &#039;wives&#039; care less for their young</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624155002.htm</link>
			<description>Sparrows form pair bonds that are normally monogamous, but many females are unfaithful to their partner and have offspring with other males. Biologists believe that the male birds are unfaithful to ensure they father as many chicks as they can, while females are unfaithful with males of better &#039;genetic quality&#039; -- ones that are fitter and could produce stronger offspring. But new research shows that cheating comes with a cost -- the cheating female&#039;s partner will provide less food for their nest of young. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Giant Blobs of Rock, Deep Inside the Earth, Hold Important Clues About Our Planet</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624155000.htm</link>
			<description>Two massive blob-like structures lie deep within the Earth, roughly on opposite sides of the planet. The two structures, each the size of a continent and 100 times taller than Mount Everest, sit on the core, 1,800 miles deep, and about halfway to the center of the Earth. Researchers suggest these blobs are made of something different from the rest of Earth&#039;s mantle, and are determined to figure out what that is. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Insects were already using camouflage 100 million years ago</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624154710.htm</link>
			<description>Those who go to a masked ball consciously slip into a different role, in order to avoid being recognized. Insects were already doing something very similar in the Cretaceous: They cloaked themselves in pieces of plants, grains of sand, or the remains of their prey, in order, for example, to be invisible to predators. Scientists hav now investigated such &#039;invisibility cloaks&#039; encased in amber. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Hairs, feathers and scales have a lot in common</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624154658.htm</link>
			<description>The potential evolutionary link between hairs in mammals, feathers in birds and scales in reptiles has been debated for decades. Today, researchers demonstrate that all these skin appendages are homologous. On the basis of analyses of embryonic development, the biologists evidenced molecular and micro-anatomical signatures that are identical between hairs, feathers and scales at their early developmental stages. These observations indicate that the three structures evolved from their common reptilian ancestor. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Researchers have documented the first known instance of insects moving prey by forming chains. In 2010, ant researchers spotted chains of bluish ants dragging a huge millipede in Phnom Kulen National Park, Cambodia. Each ant bit on a constriction on the abdomen of the ant ahead of it, while the first ant bit tight on the millipede&#039;s antenna. Walking backwards, the ants heaved the millipede away. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>What did Earth&#039;s ancient magnetic field look like?</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624135852.htm</link>
			<description>Earth&#039;s ancient magnetic field was significantly different than the present day field, originating from several poles rather than the familiar two, new research suggests. Then, shortly after our planet&#039;s core solidified, this work predicts that Earth&#039;s magnetic field transitioned to a &#039;strong,&#039; two-pole one. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Neonicotinoid pesticides cause harm to honeybees</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624135849.htm</link>
			<description>One possible cause of the alarming bee mortality we are witnessing is the use of the very active systemic insecticides called neonicotinoids. A previously unknown and harmful effect of neonicotinoids has been identified by researchers. They discovered that neonicotinoids in low and field-relevant concentrations reduce the concentration of acetylcholine in the royal jelly/larval food secreted by nurse bees. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Volcanoes get quiet before they erupt</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160623150201.htm</link>
			<description>Until now, there has not been a way to forecast eruptions of restless volcanoes because of the constant seismic activity and gas and steam emissions. Volcanologists have shown that periods of seismic quiet occur immediately before eruptions and can be used to forecast an eruption. The duration of the silence can indicate the level of energy that will be released. Longer quiet periods mean a bigger bang. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Hydrogen is the most-abundant element in the universe, but there is still so much we have to learn about it. One of the biggest unknowns is its transformation under the extreme pressures and temperatures found in the interiors of giant planets, where it is squeezed until it becomes liquid metal, capable of conducting electricity. New work measures the conditions under which hydrogen undergoes this transition in the lab and finds an intermediate &#039;dark hydrogen&#039; state. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Aging monkeys become more selective regarding their social circle</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160623122938.htm</link>
			<description>As people get older, they become choosier about how they spend their time and with whom they spend it. Now, researchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on June 23 find, based on a series of experimental and behavioral studies, that similar changes take place in Barbary macaques. The findings offer an evolutionary perspective on why aging humans behave as they do, according to the researchers. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Not only trauma but also the reversal of trauma is inherited</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160623120307.htm</link>
			<description>Behaviors caused by traumatic experiences in early life are reversible. Researchers could demonstrate that environmental enrichment allows trauma-related symptoms in mice to be reversed. This is the first evidence that positive environmental factors can correct behavioral alterations which would otherwise be transmitted to the offspring. The symptoms and their reversal are associated with epigenetic regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene. <!-- more --></description>

Astronomers recently proposed a new model that reconciles different data sets and shows that the ice shell at Enceladus&#039;s south pole may be only a few kilometers thick. This suggests that there is a strong heat source in the interior of Enceladus, an additional factor supporting the possible emergence of life in its ocean. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Immense species richness of bacterial-eating microorganisms discovered in soil</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160621111538.htm</link>
			<description>Millions of microorganisms play a major role in the decomposition of soil matter. A group of researchers has just shown that there is an enormous diversity among a group of bacteria-eating microorganisms known as Cercozoa. The research suggests that a drier climate in the years ahead due to climate change will contribute to a shift in the number of soil microorganisms, and thus, a shift in the decomposition of soil matter, with as of yet to be known consequences. <!-- more --></description>

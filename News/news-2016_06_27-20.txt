			<description>Researchers have created nanoscale electronic scaffolds that can be seeded with cardiac cells to produce a &#039;bionic&#039; cardiac patch. Once implanted, the bionic patch could act similarly to a pacemaker -- delivering electrical shocks to correct arrhythmia, but the possibilities don&#039;t end there, say researchers. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Whistling wormholes discovered in the Caribbean</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160627095933.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have discovered the Caribbean Sea works like a whistle. This finding will enable scientists to predict some sea level changes many months in advance, and may be an important factor in regulating how the Gulf Stream varies. This research has found the Caribbean Current flow is unstable, which causes it to shed eddies, or swirling currents of water hundreds of kilometers in diameter. This is similar to the way in which a jet of air sheds eddies when it hits the lip of a whistle. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>The Martian becomes reality: At least four crops grown on simulated Mars soil are edible</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160627095316.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists are working on growing crops on Mars and moon soil simulants. Just like the real Martian and moon soil these contain heavy metals in almost the same quantities. Four of the crops grown were tested for heavy metal content. No concentrations were detected that would be dangerous for human health. The four crops are therefore safe to eat and, for some heavy metals, the concentrations were even lower than in the crops grown in potting soil. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Fastest-spinning brown-dwarf star is detected by its bursts of radio waves</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160627095023.htm</link>
			<description>Astronomers have detected what may be the most rapidly rotating, ultra-cool, brown-dwarf star ever seen. The super-fast rotation period was measured by using the 305-meter Arecibo radio telescope -- the same telescope that was used to discover the first planets ever found outside our solar system. The detection emphasizes Arecibo&#039;s amazing sensitivity, which has the potential to measure the magnetic fields, which protect life, of potentially habitable planets around other stars. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>The way the ocean transported heat, nutrients and carbon dioxide at the peak of the last ice age, about 20,000 years ago, is significantly different than what has previously been suggested, according to two new studies. The findings suggest that the colder ocean circulated at a very slow rate, which enabled it to store much more carbon for much longer than the modern ocean. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Sparrows with unfaithful &#039;wives&#039; care less for their young</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624155002.htm</link>
			<description>Sparrows form pair bonds that are normally monogamous, but many females are unfaithful to their partner and have offspring with other males. Biologists believe that the male birds are unfaithful to ensure they father as many chicks as they can, while females are unfaithful with males of better &#039;genetic quality&#039; -- ones that are fitter and could produce stronger offspring. But new research shows that cheating comes with a cost -- the cheating female&#039;s partner will provide less food for their nest of young. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Giant Blobs of Rock, Deep Inside the Earth, Hold Important Clues About Our Planet</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624155000.htm</link>
			<description>Two massive blob-like structures lie deep within the Earth, roughly on opposite sides of the planet. The two structures, each the size of a continent and 100 times taller than Mount Everest, sit on the core, 1,800 miles deep, and about halfway to the center of the Earth. Researchers suggest these blobs are made of something different from the rest of Earth&#039;s mantle, and are determined to figure out what that is. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Those who go to a masked ball consciously slip into a different role, in order to avoid being recognized. Insects were already doing something very similar in the Cretaceous: They cloaked themselves in pieces of plants, grains of sand, or the remains of their prey, in order, for example, to be invisible to predators. Scientists hav now investigated such &#039;invisibility cloaks&#039; encased in amber. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Gravel-bed river floodplains are some of the most ecologically important habitats in North America, according to a new study by scientists from the US and Canada. Their research shows how broad valleys coming out of glaciated mountains provide highly productive and important habitat for a large diversity of aquatic, avian and terrestrial species. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Hairs, feathers and scales have a lot in common</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624154658.htm</link>
			<description>The potential evolutionary link between hairs in mammals, feathers in birds and scales in reptiles has been debated for decades. Today, researchers demonstrate that all these skin appendages are homologous. On the basis of analyses of embryonic development, the biologists evidenced molecular and micro-anatomical signatures that are identical between hairs, feathers and scales at their early developmental stages. These observations indicate that the three structures evolved from their common reptilian ancestor. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Researchers have documented the first known instance of insects moving prey by forming chains. In 2010, ant researchers spotted chains of bluish ants dragging a huge millipede in Phnom Kulen National Park, Cambodia. Each ant bit on a constriction on the abdomen of the ant ahead of it, while the first ant bit tight on the millipede&#039;s antenna. Walking backwards, the ants heaved the millipede away. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Behaviors caused by traumatic experiences in early life are reversible. Researchers could demonstrate that environmental enrichment allows trauma-related symptoms in mice to be reversed. This is the first evidence that positive environmental factors can correct behavioral alterations which would otherwise be transmitted to the offspring. The symptoms and their reversal are associated with epigenetic regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene. <!-- more --></description>

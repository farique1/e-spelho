			<title>Origin of extraordinary supernovae</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160607080645.htm</link>
			<description>Astronomers have demonstrated that the origin of extraordinary supernovae can be explained by the &#039;accretion scenario.&#039; The researchers discovered an anomalously strong infrared emission from &#039;the extraordinary supernova&#039; SN 2012dn, which has never been observed in other Type Ia supernovae to date. Through detailed analysis, the researchers concluded that the infrared emission comes from the material ejected from the progenitor system. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Lucy had neighbors: A review of African fossils</title>

			<description>If &#039;Lucy&#039; wasn&#039;t alone, who else was in her neighborhood? Key fossil discoveries over the last few decades in Africa indicate that multiple early human ancestor species lived at the same time more than 3 million years ago. A new review of fossil evidence from the last few decades examines four identified hominin species that co-existed between 3.8 and 3.3 million years ago during the middle Pliocene. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Ice age bison fossils shed light on early human migrations in North America</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160606154854.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists using evidence from bison fossils have determined when an ice-free corridor opened up along the Rocky Mountains during the late Pleistocene. The corridor has been considered a potential route for human and animal migrations between the far north (Alaska and Yukon) and the rest of North America, but when and how it was used has long been uncertain. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>&#039;Pristine&#039; landscapes haven&#039;t existed for thousands of years due to human activity</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160606154851.htm</link>
			<description>&#039;Pristine&#039; landscapes simply do not exist anywhere in the world today and, in most cases, have not existed for at least several thousand years. An exhaustive review of archaeological data from the last 30 years provides details of how the world&#039;s landscapes have been shaped by repeated human activity over many thousands of years. The paper reveals a pattern of significant, long-term, human influence on the distribution of species across all of the earth&#039;s major occupied continents and islands. It argues that archaeological evidence has been missing from current debates about conservation priorities. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>What is it about the sight of an infant that makes almost everyone crack a smile? Big eyes, chubby cheeks, and a button nose? An infectious laugh, soft skin, and a captivating smell? While we have long known that babies look cute, researchers have found that cuteness is designed to appeal to all our senses to trigger vital caregiving behaviors. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Inbred Neanderthals left humans a genetic burden</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160606103654.htm</link>
			<description>The Neanderthal genome included harmful mutations that made the hominids around 40 percent less reproductively fit than modern humans, according to new estimates. Non-African humans inherited some of this genetic burden when they interbred with Neanderthals, though much of it has been lost over time. The results suggest that these harmful gene variants continue to reduce the fitness of some populations today. The study also has implications for management of endangered species. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Expansion of kidney progenitor cells toward regenerative medicine</title>

			<description>The kidney is a difficult organ to regenerate. However, in a big step forward for kidney regeneration research, a collaboration between scientists from Japan and the US has successfully demonstrated a method of increasing kidney progenitor cell proliferation in vitro. This finding will allow researchers to improve the artificially generated number of these cells, which normally disappear before or soon after birth. It is expected to help future research in renal pathogenesis and regenerative medicine. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>As temperatures rise, flowers emit less scent</title>

			<description>The diverse and delicious fragrances of flowers brighten our days and inspire poetry. The more practical reason that flowers produce scent is to attract pollinating insects to the flowers&#039; reproductive organs, thereby ensuring the continued existence of plant species. New research has now indicated that increases in ambient temperature also lead to a decrease in the production of floral scents. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Researchers have demonstrated the first planar lens that works with high efficiency within the visible spectrum of light -- covering the whole range of colors from red to blue. The lens can resolve nanoscale features separated by distances smaller than the wavelength of light. It uses an ultra-thin array of tiny waveguides, known as a metasurface, which bends light as it passes through. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Hubble Space Telescope astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding 5-9% percent faster than expected. They made the discovery by refining the universe&#039;s current expansion rate to unprecedented accuracy, reducing the uncertainty to only 2.4%. The team made the refinements by developing innovative techniques that improved the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies. These measurements are fundamental to making more precise calculations of how fast the universe expands with time, a value called the Hubble constant. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Just what sustains Earth&#039;s magnetic field anyway?</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160601141512.htm</link>
			<description>Earth&#039;s magnetic field shields us from deadly cosmic radiation, and without it, life as we know it could not exist here. The motion of liquid iron in the planet&#039;s outer core, a phenomenon called a &#039;geodynamo,&#039; generates the field. But how it was first created and then sustained throughout Earth&#039;s history has remained a mystery to scientists. New work sheds light on the history of this incredibly important geologic occurrence. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Soft-bodied robots: Actuators inspired by muscle</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160601132314.htm</link>
			<description>To make robots more cooperative and have them perform tasks in close proximity to humans, they must be softer and safer. A new actuator generates movements similar to those of skeletal muscles using vacuum power to automate soft, rubber beams. Like real muscles, the actuators are soft, shock absorbing, and pose no danger to their environment or humans working collaboratively alongside them or the potential future robots equipped with them. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>First gene mutation explaining development of multiple sclerosis</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160601132134.htm</link>
			<description>Although multiple sclerosis is known to run in certain families, attempts to find genes linked to the disease have been elusive. Now for the first time researchers are reporting a gene mutation that can be connected directly to the development of the disease. <!-- more --></description>

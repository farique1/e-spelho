			<title>Bifocals in the brain</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160610095032.htm</link>
			<description>Seeing -- arguably our most important way of perceiving the world -- mostly happens without conscious intent. We see much better in the center of our visual field (along the visual axis) than in the periphery. So when our brain detects an object of interest in the periphery of our visual field, it immediately initiates an eye movement so our visual axis intersects with those objects. Once an object is in our direct line of sight, we can perceive it in far more depth and detail. Now researchers report that visual information from near and far space are processed with differing degrees of acuity. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Scientists unpack how Toxoplasma infection is linked to neurodegenerative disease</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160609150841.htm</link>
			<description>Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite, infects a third of the world&#039;s population. Working on mice, biomedical scientists report that Toxoplasma infection leads to a disruption of neurotransmitters in the brain and postulates that it triggers neurological disease in those already predisposed to such a disease. The researchers note that Toxoplasma infection leads to a significant increase in glutamate -- the primary and most important neurotransmitter in the brain. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Physicists have &#039;entangled&#039; or linked together the properties of up to 219 beryllium ions (charged atoms) to create a quantum simulator. The simulator is designed to model and mimic complex physics phenomena in a way that is impossible with conventional machines, even supercomputers. The techniques could also help improve atomic clocks. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Climate change mitigation: Turning carbon dioxide into rock</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160609142426.htm</link>
			<description>An international team of scientists have found a potentially viable way to remove anthropogenic (caused or influenced by humans) carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere - turn it into rock. The study has shown for the first time that the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide can be permanently and rapidly locked away from the atmosphere, by injecting it into volcanic bedrock. The carbon dioxide reacts with the surrounding rock, forming environmentally benign minerals. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Large animals hunted for their parts -- such as elephant ivory and shark fins -- are in double jeopardy of extinction due to their large body size and high value, according to a new analysis. The study reveals underappreciated risk to marine species similar to that of iconic terrestrial species, but elevated by key differences in the sea. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Autism is not just a disorder of the brain, mouse study suggests</title>

			<description>Autism spectrum disorders are generally thought to be caused by deficits in brain development, but a study in mice now suggests that at least some aspects of the disorder -- including how touch is perceived, anxiety, and social abnormalities -- are linked to defects in another area of the nervous system, the peripheral nerves found throughout the limbs, digits, and other parts of the body that communicate sensory information to the brain. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Bacteria perfected protein complexes more than 3.5 billion years ago</title>

			<description>Researchers are resurrecting ancient bacterial protein complexes to determine how 3.5-billion-year-old cells functioned versus cells of today. Surprisingly, they are not that different. Despite a popular hypothesis that primordial organisms had simple enzyme proteins, evidence suggests that bacteria around 500 million years after life began already had the sophisticated cellular machinery that exists today. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Weak bees make strong colonies</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160609115605.htm</link>
			<description>Colonies of the Eastern honey bee, the original host of parasitic Varroa destructor mites, survive infestations that are fatal to Western honey bees. A research team has now discovered that a large proportion of infested Eastern honey bee larvae die, prompting their elimination from the colony, together with that of their parasites. Counter-intuitively, weak individuals contribute to society survival by preventing the parasite to spread. This is an example of how altruistic suicide can be favored by nature. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Skilled readers can quickly recognize words when they read because the word has been placed in a visual dictionary of sorts which functions separately from an area that processes the sounds of written words, say neuroscientists. The visual dictionary idea rebuts a common theory that our brain needs to &quot;sound out&quot; words each time we see them. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>It is thought that ants evolved about 150 million years ago and have risen to dominance in the past 60 million years. They are now everywhere and while they are not always welcome on your kitchen counter, they are critical to ecosystems around the world for many roles, including seed dispersal and decomposition. Now new research shows that past land connections, as well as current climate, are shown to be of primary importance in determining ant diversity patterns. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>For the first time, astronomers have detected billowy clouds of cold, clumpy gas streaming toward a black hole, at the center of a massive galaxy cluster. The clouds are traveling at speeds of up to 355 kilometers per second -- that&#039;s almost 800,000 miles per hour -- and may be only 150 light years away from its edge, almost certain to fall into the black hole, feeding its bottomless well. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Obesity is linked to changes in our gut microbes -- the trillions of tiny organisms that inhabit our intestines. But the mechanism has not been clear to date. In a new study, a team of researchers has identified how an altered gut microbiota causes obesity. <!-- more --></description>

Scientists wanted to find out what the atmospheres of these giant worlds have in common. Researchers focused on a collection of hot Jupiters studied by NASA&#039;s Hubble Space Telescope. They found that the atmospheres of about half of the planets were blocked by clouds or haze. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Ice age bison fossils shed light on early human migrations in North America</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160606154854.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists using evidence from bison fossils have determined when an ice-free corridor opened up along the Rocky Mountains during the late Pleistocene. The corridor has been considered a potential route for human and animal migrations between the far north (Alaska and Yukon) and the rest of North America, but when and how it was used has long been uncertain. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>&#039;Pristine&#039; landscapes haven&#039;t existed for thousands of years due to human activity</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160606154851.htm</link>
			<description>&#039;Pristine&#039; landscapes simply do not exist anywhere in the world today and, in most cases, have not existed for at least several thousand years. An exhaustive review of archaeological data from the last 30 years provides details of how the world&#039;s landscapes have been shaped by repeated human activity over many thousands of years. The paper reveals a pattern of significant, long-term, human influence on the distribution of species across all of the earth&#039;s major occupied continents and islands. It argues that archaeological evidence has been missing from current debates about conservation priorities. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Genetic variations linked with social, economic success</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160606142900.htm</link>
			<description>Psychological characteristics link genes with upward social mobility, according to data collected from almost 1,000 individuals over four decades. The data suggest that various psychological factors play a role in linking a person&#039;s genetic profile and several important life outcomes, including professional achievement, financial security, geographic mobility, and upward social mobility. <!-- more --></description>

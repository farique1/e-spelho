			<title>Pituitary tissue grown from human stem cells releases hormones in rats</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160614133606.htm</link>
			<description>Researchers have successfully used human stem cells to generate functional pituitary tissue that secretes hormones important for the body&#039;s stress response as well as for its growth and reproductive functions. When transplanted into rats with hypopituitarism -- a disease linked to dwarfism and premature aging in humans -- the lab-grown pituitary cells promoted normal hormone release. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Drum beats from a one atom thick graphite membrane</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160614100256.htm</link>
			<description>Researchers demonstrate the ability to electrically manipulate the vibrations of a drum, of nanometer scale thickness, a million times smaller than that of human hair. These drums vibrate a whopping 100 million times a second -- which cannot be heard by the ear but can be sensed using small circuits. This can be used to make new kinds of mass sensors. Also, new aspects of fundamental physics could be probed in the future. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Marine life quickly recovered after global mass extinction</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160613164957.htm</link>
			<description>Reptiles rapidly invaded the seas soon after a global extinction wiped out most life on Earth, according to a new study. The oldest marine reptile fossils appeared 248.81 million years ago, the most precise date yet, according to the study. These pioneering marine reptiles, including the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and sauropterygians, went on to rule the Mesozoic seas during the era of the dinosaurs. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>In the days following the April 2015 earthquake in Nepal, afterslip produced little surface evidence of continued movement. That meant only one of two things could be happening: either the part of the fault that hadn&#039;t moved was experiencing a slow-slip event, a slow-motion earthquake, or it remained completely locked, accumulating further strain in that segment of the fault. A new research paper finds it is likely the latter. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Bifocals in the brain</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160610095032.htm</link>
			<description>Seeing -- arguably our most important way of perceiving the world -- mostly happens without conscious intent. We see much better in the center of our visual field (along the visual axis) than in the periphery. So when our brain detects an object of interest in the periphery of our visual field, it immediately initiates an eye movement so our visual axis intersects with those objects. Once an object is in our direct line of sight, we can perceive it in far more depth and detail. Now researchers report that visual information from near and far space are processed with differing degrees of acuity. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Deep &#039;scars&#039; from ancient geological events play role in current earthquakes</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160610094437.htm</link>
			<description>Super-computer modelling of Earth&#039;s crust and upper-mantle suggests that ancient geologic events may have left deep &#039;scars&#039; that can come to life to play a role in earthquakes, mountain formation, and other ongoing processes on our planet. These multi-million-year-old structures, situated at sites away from existing plate boundaries, may trigger changes in the structure and properties at the surface in the interior regions of continents. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>When healthcare providers know they are being watched, they are twice as likely to comply with hand hygiene guidelines. This is in comparison to when healthcare providers do not know someone is watching, according to a new study. This phenomenon -- called The Hawthorne Effect -- impacts the ability to capture accurate human behavior because individuals modify their actions when they know they are being observed. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite, infects a third of the world&#039;s population. Working on mice, biomedical scientists report that Toxoplasma infection leads to a disruption of neurotransmitters in the brain and postulates that it triggers neurological disease in those already predisposed to such a disease. The researchers note that Toxoplasma infection leads to a significant increase in glutamate -- the primary and most important neurotransmitter in the brain. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>An international team of scientists have found a potentially viable way to remove anthropogenic (caused or influenced by humans) carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere - turn it into rock. The study has shown for the first time that the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide can be permanently and rapidly locked away from the atmosphere, by injecting it into volcanic bedrock. The carbon dioxide reacts with the surrounding rock, forming environmentally benign minerals. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Colonies of the Eastern honey bee, the original host of parasitic Varroa destructor mites, survive infestations that are fatal to Western honey bees. A research team has now discovered that a large proportion of infested Eastern honey bee larvae die, prompting their elimination from the colony, together with that of their parasites. Counter-intuitively, weak individuals contribute to society survival by preventing the parasite to spread. This is an example of how altruistic suicide can be favored by nature. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Scientists observe supermassive black hole feeding on cold gas</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160608142602.htm</link>
			<description>For the first time, astronomers have detected billowy clouds of cold, clumpy gas streaming toward a black hole, at the center of a massive galaxy cluster. The clouds are traveling at speeds of up to 355 kilometers per second -- that&#039;s almost 800,000 miles per hour -- and may be only 150 light years away from its edge, almost certain to fall into the black hole, feeding its bottomless well. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>How altered gut microbes cause obesity</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160608142554.htm</link>
			<description>Obesity is linked to changes in our gut microbes -- the trillions of tiny organisms that inhabit our intestines. But the mechanism has not been clear to date. In a new study, a team of researchers has identified how an altered gut microbiota causes obesity. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Cloudy days on exoplanets may hide atmospheric water</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160608130848.htm</link>
			<description>Astronomers have found many hot Jupiters with water in their atmospheres, but others appear to have none. Scientists wanted to find out what the atmospheres of these giant worlds have in common. Researchers focused on a collection of hot Jupiters studied by NASA&#039;s Hubble Space Telescope. They found that the atmospheres of about half of the planets were blocked by clouds or haze. <!-- more --></description>

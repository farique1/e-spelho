			<title>Mouse models of Zika in pregnancy show how fetuses become infected</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160511131718.htm</link>
			<description>Two mouse models of Zika virus infection in pregnancy have been developed. In them, the virus migrated from the pregnant mouse&#039;s bloodstream into the placenta, where it multiplied, then spread into the fetal circulation and infected the brains of the developing pups. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Fetal mice with Zika infection get microcephaly</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160511131707.htm</link>
			<description>Mouse fetuses injected with the Asian Zika virus strain and carried to term within their pregnant mothers display the characteristic features of microcephaly, researchers report. As expected, the virus infected the neural progenitor cells, and infected brains reveal expression of genes related to viral entry, altered immune response, and cell death. The authors say this is direct evidence that Zika infection causes microcephaly in an animal model. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>The sun&#039;s outer layer, the corona, constantly streams out charged particles called the solar wind. But it&#039;s not the kind of wind you can fly a kite in. Even the slowest solar wind can reach speeds 700,000 mph. And while scientists know a great deal about solar wind, the source and causes of the slow wind remain mysterious. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Highway noise deters communication between birds</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160511093144.htm</link>
			<description>Northern cardinals and tufted titmice are two abundant bird species in the woods of eastern North America. Many bird and mammal species rely on information from tufted titmice calls to detect and respond to dangerous predators. This causes important information networks to form around tufted titmouse communication. Results of a new study suggests that too much noise around highways keeps birds from hearing warnings from fellow birds about predators in the area, and that puts them at a higher risk of being eaten. It is also possible that the birds are hearing the alarms, but are too distracted by the noise to respond to them. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Hijacked cell division helped fuel rise of fungi</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160510124654.htm</link>
			<description>The more than 90,000 known species of fungi may owe their abilities to spread and even cause disease to an ancient virus that hijacked their cell division machinery, researchers report. Over a billion years ago, a viral protein invaded the fungal genome, generating a family of proteins that now play key roles in fungal growth.

			<description>Fatal crashes involving drivers who recently used marijuana doubled in Washington after the state legalized the drug, according to the latest research. New research also shows that legal limits for marijuana and driving are arbitrary and unsupported by science, which could result in unsafe motorists going free and others being wrongfully convicted for impaired driving. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Pathologic changes of the retina caused by diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in working adults. Diabetic retinopathy has no known cure, treatment options are inadequate, and prevention strategies offer limited protection. In the first of its kind, a report in The American Journal of Pathology describes a potential new intraocular treatment based on manipulating the renin angiotensin system (RAS) that both prevents and reverses some characteristics of diabetic retinopathy in a mouse model. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>A recent study suggests that who we are might be more integrated with where we are than previously thought. The fact that experience can shape individual differences, which in turn can affect the quality of spatial and social cognition a person, suggests that growing up in certain built environments can have detrimental or beneficial effects on their cognitive ability. This brings up questions such as whether raising children in enclosed spaces versus open spaces will result in differences in spatial and social cognition. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Simulating the evolution of Mars volcano Olympus Mons</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160509085751.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have succeeded in creating a model simulating the formation of mysterious structures on the surface of the Mars volcano, Olympus Mons. The research project is based on image data of the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) that is installed on the European Mars Express spacecraft, which has been orbiting the red planet since December 2003. Using the camera images, the scientists in the Planetary Sciences and Remote Sensing group generated a mosaic and a terrain model of the Olympus Mons volcano. The image data show that the volcano shield is shaped in the form of arched terraces and the foot of the otherwise very flat volcano drops steeply. The origin of the terraces and the steep slope of Olympus Mons were discussed heatedly in previous publications. <!-- more --></description>

The scientists have identified key genes involved in the fruit fly&#039;s ability to detect changes in external humidity, and they also discovered the sensory neurons -- the fly&#039;s humidity receptors -- in a strange, small sac in the insect&#039;s antennae. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Continental drift created biologically diverse coral reefs</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160506095652.htm</link>
			<description>An international research team has studied the geographical pattern of the evolution of corals and reef fish. Their findings show that today&#039;s geographical distribution of tropical marine diversity is the result of 100 million years of Earth history and the continental drifts that shifted the position of shallow reef habitats. <!-- more --></description>

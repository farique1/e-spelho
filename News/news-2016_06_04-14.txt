			<title>New radio map of Jupiter reveals what&#039;s beneath colorful clouds</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160602151727.htm</link>
			<description>Using the upgraded Very Large Array, astronomers have produced a detailed radio map of the upper 100 kilometers of Jupiter&#039;s atmosphere, revealing the complex movement of ammonia gas that shapes the colorful clouds observed in the optical. The map will help understand how global circulation and cloud formation are driven by Jupiter&#039;s powerful internal heat source, and shed light on similar processes on giant planets in our solar system and around distant stars. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Dogs were domesticated not once, but twice ... in different parts of the world</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160602151723.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have compared genetic data with existing archaeological evidence and show that man&#039;s best friend may have emerged independently from two separate (possibly now extinct) wolf populations that lived on opposite sides of the Eurasian continent. This means that dogs may have been domesticated not once, as widely believed, but twice. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Wiretapping the senses: Scientists monitor conversation between sensory perception, behavior in the mouse brain</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160602132636.htm</link>
			<description>Sensory information enters the brain at the primary sensory cortex, where they are processed by different layers of cells in ways that ultimately influence an animal&#039;s perception and behavioral response. Scientists have now watched the flow of information between the different layers of the cortex for the first time in awake, active mice. Their work provides new insights into links between sensory stimuli and behavior. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>The universe is expanding even faster than expected</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160602122506.htm</link>
			<description>Hubble Space Telescope astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding 5-9% percent faster than expected. They made the discovery by refining the universe&#039;s current expansion rate to unprecedented accuracy, reducing the uncertainty to only 2.4%. The team made the refinements by developing innovative techniques that improved the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies. These measurements are fundamental to making more precise calculations of how fast the universe expands with time, a value called the Hubble constant. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Just what sustains Earth&#039;s magnetic field anyway?</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160601141512.htm</link>
			<description>Earth&#039;s magnetic field shields us from deadly cosmic radiation, and without it, life as we know it could not exist here. The motion of liquid iron in the planet&#039;s outer core, a phenomenon called a &#039;geodynamo,&#039; generates the field. But how it was first created and then sustained throughout Earth&#039;s history has remained a mystery to scientists.

			<title>Soft-bodied robots: Actuators inspired by muscle</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160601132314.htm</link>
			<description>To make robots more cooperative and have them perform tasks in close proximity to humans, they must be softer and safer. A new actuator generates movements similar to those of skeletal muscles using vacuum power to automate soft, rubber beams. Like real muscles, the actuators are soft, shock absorbing, and pose no danger to their environment or humans working collaboratively alongside them or the potential future robots equipped with them. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Neanderthals used fire in caves: French cave sheds new light on the Neanderthals</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160601083926.htm</link>
			<description>Deep inside Bruniquel Cave, in the Tarn et Garonne region of southwestern France, a set of human-made structures 336 meters from the entrance was recently dated as being approximately 176,500 years old. This discovery indicates that humans began occupying caves much earlier than previously thought: until now the oldest formally proven cave use dated back only 38,000 years (Chauvet). It also ranks the Bruniquel structures among the very first in human history. In addition, traces of fire show that the early Neanderthals, well before Homo sapiens, knew how to use fire to circulate in enclosed spaces far from daylight. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Elliptical galaxies not formed by merging</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160601083920.htm</link>
			<description>Using an &quot;intuitive&quot; approach, a new study confirms a recent hypothesis on the formation of galaxies, according to which the larger elliptical galaxies formed in very ancient times through a process of local (in situ) star formation. This contradicts the current paradigm that they formed through the merging  of spiral galaxies, a view which, despite being generally accepted by most of the scientific community, has been a source of theoretical inconsistencies. The study supports the in situ hypothesis, already proposed with theoretical models, basing itself only on the analysis and interpolation of new data collected by the Herschel instrument (in the infrared) integrated with Hubble data (in the ultraviolet), an innovative yet simple method. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Arctic Ocean methane does not reach the atmosphere</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160527112654.htm</link>
			<description>250 methane flares release the climate gas methane from the seabed and into the Arctic Ocean. During the summer months this leads to an increased methane concentration in the ocean. But surprisingly, very little of the climate gas rising up through the sea reaches the atmosphere, report investigators. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Hawk moths have second nose for evaluating flowers</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160527112650.htm</link>
			<description>Manduca sexta hawk moth use their proboscis to smell the floral volatiles when they visit flowers, report scientists. They discovered the olfactory neurons involved in the perception of these volatiles on the Manduca proboscis. Only when flowers produced volatiles did the moths stay long enough to drink nectar, and only then did they deliver enough pollen on their proboscis to successfully pollinate other scenting flowers. <!-- more --></description>

			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160527090646.htm</link>
			<description>Fossil remains of a previously unknown family of carnivorous Australian marsupials that lived 15 million years ago have been discovered at the Riversleigh World Heritage Fossil Site in north-western Queensland. The ancient animals appeared to eat snails using a huge, hammer-like premolar that would have been able to crack the strongest of snail shells. <!-- more --></description>
